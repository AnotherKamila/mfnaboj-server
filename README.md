mfnaboj-server: a pretty server for our great contest
=====================================================

MFnaboj is/will be a global math+physics competition for elementary school students, thus being some sort of a "pre-([FKS](http://fks.sk/naboj/naboj.php)|[KMS](http://www.kms.sk/naboj_whatis)) naboj" thing.

This repo contains/will contain the server I am developing for this contest, as our previous solution (an online spreadsheet) did not prove to be reliable enough (not to mention that it wasn't very fast). The plan is to have a server that *will* be reliable and fast (even if we manage to expand to an international scale), and to learn a lot while making it. For a description of what it is supposed to do, see the docs (which serve as a design document too).

If you would like to talk into the development, feel free to comment on code, file issues or send pull requests -- any help is appreciated.
