mfnaboj-server: a pretty server for our great contest
=====================================================

MFnaboj is/will be a global math+physics competition for elementary school students, thus being some sort of a pre-(FKS|KMS) naboj thing.

This repo contains/will contain the server I am developing for this contest, as our previous solution (an online spreadsheet) did not prove to be reliable enough. The plan is to have a server that will be reliable and fast, and to learn a lot while making it. For a description of what it is supposed to do, see the docs (which serve as a design document too).
